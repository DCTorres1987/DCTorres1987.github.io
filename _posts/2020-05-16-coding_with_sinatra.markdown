Sinatra, I fear, will get me kicked out of the program. I was already behind. Studying in the early a.m. to up my skills in Tableau and Power BI. Working in the morning until the late afternoon and the rest of the evening making my way through Sinatra.  I am really burnt out. Prone to falling asleep for split seconds at a time nearly falling out my chair a few times. 

I was worried that I would not be skilled enough to complete my project, but I began working on it step by step. I planned a website where I could track my google book library collection using an API.  My website would allow users to review, create, edit, and delete a book review. I watched various videos as a resource to better understand how to call an API in sinatra.  I setup my local environment, connected to github, install bundler and all the necessary pre-setup.  I began writing my code until my website began coming to life.  

I  seeked consulation with a fellow student and discovered that all my work was done incorrectly, that I was not following the CRUD method and was very disorganized.  I began to panic.  I thought I was never going to fix everything in time, but with a little guidance I began updating the code, making sure I was coding my get, post, patch, and delete appropriately. In order to fix my website, I had to break my website and code everything right.  I was able to slowly put it back together piece by piece.  

I scheduled a 1:1 with my cohort lead to show my work and get his opinion on a few things I was stuck on and I also demoed my work to my boyfriend practicing explaining how my website worked. I am proud of my work. Now the final step begins. Preparing for my assessment.
