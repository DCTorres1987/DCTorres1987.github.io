Hello Everyone!

Thank you so much for checking out my blog. I'm currently planning out my next project and how I would like it to be built. I would like to build a note taker app that will help me and possibly others study various subjects. 

This application will allow the user to add, edit, delete a category, subject, or notes. The backend will be built using Ruby and the frontend using React.js/Redux. 

The table relationships should be something like:

* A User can have many notes
* A Note belongs to a User

* A Note can have many Categories (i.e. JavaScript, React.js)
* A Category belongs to a Note

* A Category can have many Subjects (i.e. variables in JavaScript)
* A Subject belongs to a Category

* A Subject can have many Notes
* A Note Belongs to a Subject

I did a small diagram in draw.i.o to show how I would like my application layed out.

I think we are almost ready to begin coding. I'm very excited!
