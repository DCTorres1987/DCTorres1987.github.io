I love to practice algorithm challenges on HackerRank using SQL, Ruby, and Javascript. As it gives me a chance to utilize my skills and problem solve. 

Here are the steps I use to complete each challenge. 

I first read over the information provided carefully to get an understading of what is being asked then I work out the problem on paper or white board it.

This gives me the chance to look for patterns. Think of ways to solve the problem in the most efficent way possible.

I begin coding and console.log, puts, or run the code as I go along to get an idea of how the data looks. If needed, I review the different types of loops or iterations to get the best returned output.

It's a process. Some solutions does not work and I have to try something different. Once I complete the problem and all test are passing I begin leaving notes for myself explaining how I solved the problem. 

This process has been a great help to me and I hope it helps you too. I was told by an awesome VP of Engineering, there are many ways to solve a problem and to only worry about solving it in the most brute force way as possible. Then go back and better the performance.

Keep coding everyone!
