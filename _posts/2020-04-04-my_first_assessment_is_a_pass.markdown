The day of my assessment, I was soo nervous I could hardly focus.  I was fairly confident of my CLI project and felt prepared to demo my work. However, I feared being tested on concepts learned through out the months.  In my mind, I thought I was going to fail to give the correct answers that was being asked of me.  This fear made me write every concept I had learned on to my white erase board and try to cement everything to mind, but I felt that this wasn't enough. Thoughts of failing and getting kicked out of the cohort fogged my mind and made it hard to focus, but I didn't let this stop me.

An hour before my assessment was set to begin, I demo my work to my cohort lead and did one last review of the concepts I thought was going to be discussed until it was finally go time.  I signed on to zoom and my assessment began.  It was not as bad as my mind made it out to be. My nervousness began to ease and I became more confident as time passed.  Before I knew it, it was all over and my reviewer told me I had passed. I was so elated that I jumped up and down in place after the zoom was over. The only thing I need to continue to work on is live coding. I need to practice at least once a week. The one thing important thing I learned from this experiance is to never let your mind sych you out. In your mind a situation is a category 5 problem, when its only a walk in the park.
