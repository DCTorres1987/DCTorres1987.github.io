I had become complacent. Satisfied with making bare minimum salary and being ok with living from paycheck to paycheck.  I was burnt out and was coming to the scary realization when I began looking for a new job that I was underskilled. Many jobs required more skills than I had aquired working 9 years as an Application Analyst and I was being turned down for the jobs I did applied for. I needed a change. 

I began researching ways to educate myself and tried various sites such as Udemy and LinkedIn but I needed more structure. I had a hard time self starting especially with me having a full-time job during the week, assisting with taking care of my Dad who is in the advance stages of Pick's Disease, and working part-time on the weekends as a Instacart Shopper. I then found FlatIron. I began learning about the school and how many students became Software Engineers in less than a year rather than attending a college/university.  They would even help me find a job.  I took a leap of faith and applied and now I'm 4 days in the program and so excited to see what happens next.
