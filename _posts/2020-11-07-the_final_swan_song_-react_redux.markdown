I battled the Javascript Giant and won. I Won! 

Now its time for the final battle. Going through the labs for React and Redux was very intimidating not as much as Javascript when I was initilly introduced. What made React and Redux difficult is the fact there is so much to learn. It was fun and so scary at the same time. 

There goes my friend fear again. I know, you tired of hearing of my friend, but much like all besties they stick with you through thick and thin. 

When it came to doing my project. I truly was exicted. I was worried that I wouldn't understand enough to do the work but I pulled up my sleeves and began coding. I followed the same process I took when coding Sinatra, Ruby on Rails, and Javascript. I planned everything out, my ideas changed as I went along, but the objective remained the same. Code something I could be proud of and hopefully in finding that pride, I will find that others are proud of me too.

I began reviewing my resources, and troubleshooting errors when encountered, and I kept on coding. I built my stateless and container components. I made sure that my middleware was configured correctly so that I could use thunk to dispatch my various actions to my reducers. These reducers return a new state that will allow my parent component to pass data to my routers and presentational components to render data to the DOM for users to interact with. 

After completing everything, I worry if its enough. Everything appears to meet the requirement but now its time to study and prepare for the upcoming assessment that will be the most challenging yet...picking up my sword and shield once again, I'm ready to complete my final chapter in my Flat Iron Saga.  Everything that I've studied for and built with the guidance of this school has prepared me for this moment. Let's go!
