As I work through Sinatra, I can't help but wonder how tough my next project is going to be.  Despite this worry I remain very excited about learning how to develop websites. A lot of the same concepts apply from when we created class methods, but now we are just utilizing it in a new way.  I love how we are able create submit buttons just with a few lines of code and be able to display how little by little we bring our website to life.  Already I'm beginning to formulate ideas on what my project could be.
