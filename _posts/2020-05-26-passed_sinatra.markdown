I can't explain the happiness that I felt when I was told I passed my assessment. I loved the little website I built and I put in a lot of hard work. I wanted my reviewer to love it too and he did. The website that I had built worked without no issues. I made a few last minute changes to prevent users not logged in from navigate throughout the website after speaking with another student and getting the idea. If a user trys to navigate to any page that is only for logged in users it will route them back to the landing page (homepage). I also looked up how to apply validations so it will flash an error message if the user doesn't populate an required field. 

I want to continue to add to my website. Make it better so I can share my work on LinkedIn. I'm so excited to see what comes next in this journey.
