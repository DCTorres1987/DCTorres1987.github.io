Methods, Loops, and Hashes..Oh my!  How quickly did the first mile go by.  I can't help but feel a sense of excitement as I feel one step closer to my ultimate goal. However, I also feel a sense of forboding.  There is a little voice in the back of my head whispering words of doubt. What if I'm not good enough.  What if know one wants to higher me and the career I want is forever out of my reach. I don't let it get to me.  As I continue to pass each lab I feel more and more like I can do this. As long as I give it my very best and keep trying I know I can succeed. I'm ready for the next challenge
