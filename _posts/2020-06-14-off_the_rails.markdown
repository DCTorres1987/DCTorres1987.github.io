Rails is like magic and a nightmare at the same time. There are so many concepts to take in and understand in a short amount of time.  Sinatra has put me a week behind and I work tirelessly and to catch up and understand the lessons that is being being taught to me. Its not very easy, but I'm not a quitter.

Often I feel their is never enough time in a day to work, maintain school, and normal important life stuff. I know, the same cry all us adults who are attempting to go back to school and maintain normal life balance.  It's not easy, but what part of life is. Others have made it, so will I.

I'm going to knuckle down, and work on understanding these concepts that are being taught in Rails as it will make building websites much easier once mastered.  Can't Stop, Won't Stop.
